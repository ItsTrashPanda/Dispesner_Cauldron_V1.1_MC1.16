# Dispesner_Cauldron_V1.1_MC1.16
Minecraft Datapack that lets you use a dispenser on a cauldron using buckets.

# Note From Maker
As far as I can tell this has no bugs, I do not foresee myself updating this unless bugs arise. In the unlikely case that this becomes popular and people want me to add water bottle functionality I might do that but otherwise, I consider this finished. I am working on a 1.17 version as of posting this that will include fucnctionality for both lava and powdered snow which I will include a link to once that gets finished.

# Pls don't steal this and call it your own
I really could care less about this. I put very little effort into it, so little that I didn't put any formal copyright on this so... just don't steal it.
